# Length
How to manage **a long sentence** gracefully, how to make it as clear as vigorous as a serious of short ones.

## Cordination
We should join gramatically equal segments most gracefully after the subject, **in the predicate**. If we extend a sentence by coordinating its parts, we should coordinate after the subject.

Two Problems:
### Faulty Parallelism
We should coordinate elements only of the **same grammatical structure**.

The advertisements persuade us
- **that** the corporation suppors environmentalism *but not*
- **to** buy its frivolous products.

The advertisements persuade us
- **that** the corporation suppors environmentalism *but not*
- **that** we should buy its frivolous products.

#### Exceptions
1. Writers frequently join a noun phrase with a how-clause,
2. Or an adjective or adverb with a propositional phrase

Every attempt will be made to delineate
- **the problems** of biomedical education among the underdeveloped nations *and*
- **how** a coordinated effort can address them in the most economical and expeditious way.

The grant proposal appears to have been written
- **intelligently, carefully,** *and*
- **with** the full cooperation of all the agencies whose interests this project involves.

### Lost Connections
Try **repeating a word** that will remind the reader where the second half of the coordination begins. Make the beginning of parallel parts more obvious.

Every teacher ought to remind himself
- **that** his students are vulnerable to those ego-brusing moments that adults have learned to cope with *and*
- **that** those students do not understand that one day...

Every teacher ought
- **to remind himself that** his students are vulnerable to those ego-brusing moments that adults have learned to cope with *and*
- **to remind himself that** those students do not understand that one day...

## Subordination
### Resumptive Modifiers
Repeat a keyword close to the end of a clause and then resume the line of thought with a relative clause, elaborating on what went before.

For several years the Columbia Broadcasting System created and developed situation **comedies** that were the best that American TV had to offer,
- **comedies** such as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "All in the Family",
- **comedies** that sparkled with wit and invention

### Summative Modifiers
End a segment of a sentence with a comma, then sum up in a noun or noun phrase what you have just said, and then continue with a relative clause, an alternative device to avoid the potential ambiguity of a vague **which**.

In the last five years, European population growth has dropped to almost zero,
- **a demographic event that** in years to come will have profound social implications.

The employees took the U.S. Government to court, claiming that the order violated their Fourth Amendment rights, **rights** that protect us against unreasonable search and seizure.

### Free modifiers
Free modifier follows the verb but comments on its subject, including infinitive verb and adjactive. It usually makes more specific what you assert in the proceding clause that you attach to.

Socrates relentlessly questioned the very foundations of social and political behavour,
- forcing his fellow citizens to examine the duty they owed to the laws of their gods and to the laws of their state,
- encouraging young people to question the authority of their elders,
- maintaining all the while that he was only trying in his poor inadequate way to puzzle out the truth as best he could.

## Movement and Momentum
**Subject-verb, verb-object**

We should be able to complete those links quickly and surely. It is okay to have a short modifier between them. But a long phrase or a clause is unacceptable.

A semantic theory, **[**if it is to represent **[**in real-time terms**]** on-line cognitive behavior**]**, must propose more neurally plausible psychological process than those described here.

If a semantic theory is to represent on-line cognitive in real-time terms, it must propose more neurally plausible psychological process than those described here.

### Gramatical Connections
Scientists the world over, **because** they deliberately write in a style that is aloof, impersonal, and objective, have difficulty communicating with laypeople.

Because scientists the world over deliberately write in a style that is aloof, impersonal, and objective, they have difficulty communicating with laypeople.

### The Smallest Connections
Look closely for **adjactives that have become separated from the phrases** that modify them.
- as accurate ... as any that could be provided
- more seriously ... than what

The accountant has given **as accurate** a projection **as** any that could be provided.

The accountant has given a projection **as accurate as** any that could be provided.

## Problem with Modifiers
### Dangling Modifier
A modifier "dangles" when its **implied subject differs** from the specific subject of the clause that follows it.

In order to contain the epidemic the area was sealed off.

Either rewrite the introductory phrase so that it has its own subject or make the subject of the main clause agree with the implied subject of the introductory phrase.

In order **for us** to contain the epidemic the area was sealed off.

In order to contain the epidemic we sealed off the area.


### Misplaced Modifier
Sometime a modifier seems to modify two things, or the wrong thing.
#### Either Forward or Back
We failed **entirely** to understand the complexities of the problem.
- We **entirely** failed to understand ...
- We failed to **entirely** understand ...

#### At the End of a Clause
Scientists have learned that their observation are as necessary subjective as those in any other field **in recent years**.
- **In recent years**, scientists have learned that ...
- Scientists have learned that **in recent years** ...


#### Pronoun Reference
If there is a slightest chance that a pronoun will confuse your reader, don't hesitate to **repeat the antecedent**.

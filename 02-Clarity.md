# Clarity
- Charactors to subjects
- Actions to verbs
- Proper Nominalization and passive voice

## The First Two Principles of Clear Writing
1. the subjects of the sentences name the cast of charactors
2. the verbs that go with those subjects name the crutial actions those charactors are part of

## Subjects and Charactors
- Agents
- Implied in an adjactive
- Far removed
- In form of *'s* or as an object of *by*, *of* or *on the part of*
- Indefinite because the sentence expresses a general statement
 - As English is lacking indefinite pronoun, we need to use *royal we* or passive voice.


## Verb and actions: Nominalization
- Our request is that on your return, you conduct a review of the data and provide an immediate report.
- We request that when you return, you review the data and report immediately.


## Bad Nominalization -> Verb
- **Empty verb + Nominalization -> Verb**
 - The committee has no expectation that it will meet the deadline.
 - The committee doesn't expect that it will meet the deadline.
- ** *There be* + Nominalization -> Subject + Verb**
 - There is a need for further study of this program.
 - The engineers must study this program further.
 - There was considerable erosion of the land from the floods.
 - The floods considerably eroded the land.
- **Nominalization (as a subject) + Empty verb -> Subject + Verb**
 - Our discussion concerned a tax cut.
 - We discussed a tax cut.
- **Consecutive Nominalization -> Verb + *how*/*why* clause**
 - There was first a review of the evolution of the dorsal fin.
 - First, she reviewed the evolution of the dorsal fin.
 - First, she reviewed how the dorsal fin evolved.
- **Nominalization + logically connecting verb + Nominalization -> Clause + conjunction + Clause**
 - Their cessation of hostilities was because of their personnel losses.
 - They ceassed hostolities because they lost personnel.


## Good Nominalization
- **Subject referring a previous sentence**
 - This decision can lead to costly consequences.
- **Naming what would be the object of its verb**
 - I do not understand either her meanings or his intention.
 - I do not understand either what she means or what he intents.
- **Replacing *The fact that* (similar to referring a sentence)**
 - My denial of this accusations impressed the jury.
 - The fact that I denied this accusations impressed the jury.
- **Referring an often repeated concept**
 - Taxation without representations was not the central concern of the American Revolution.
- ** *There be* + Nominalization when developing in subsequent sentences**
 - There is no need for .... There is need, however, for ...
- **Abstract and impersonal topic (to avoid royal we or empty subject)**
 - The cognitive component of intention exhibits a high degree of complexity.
 - When an actor intents anything, he behaves in ways that are cognitively complex.


## Passive or Active
- **Whether the agent is known or needed.**
 - Those who are found guilty of murder can be executed.
- **The subjects in a sequence of sentences should be consistent.**
 - By March of 1945, the Axis nations had been essentially defeated; all that remains was a final, but bloody, climax. The borders of Germany had been breached, and both Germany and Japan were being bombed around the clock. Neither country, though, had been so devastated that it could not resist.
 - By March of 1945, the Alies had essentially defeated the Axis nations; all that remained was a final, but bloody, climax. American, Franch and British forces had breached the borders of Germany and were bombing both Germany and Japan around the clock. But they had not so thoroughtly devastated either country as to destroy its ability to resist.

## Metadiscourse

- Metadiscourse: **writing about writing**
 - in writing about some subject matter, we incidentally refer to the act and to the context of writing about it.
 - We will explain; we shall show; in conclusion; ...
- When write in the passive, the writer may unselfconsciously dangled his modifier.
 - To determine if ..., I added ... (First-person subject)
 - To determine if ..., ... was added. (Dangling)

Trade off between First-Person Subjective and Dangling Modifiers


## Summing Up
- **Express actions and conditions in specific verbs, adverbs or adjectives**
 - The intention of the committee is the improvement of morale.
 - The committee intents to improve morale.
- **When appropriate, make the subject of your verbs characters involved in those actions.**

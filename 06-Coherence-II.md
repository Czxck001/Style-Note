# Coherence II
Points


## What is the Point?

Principle 4. A reader will feel that a paragraph is coherent if she can read  sentence that specifically articulates its point.

A point is
- Notion of new idea or thought
- A sentence or two that encapsulated some clear statement that we could recognize as the most important sentence in the paragraph

The better question is not "What's your point", but "Where's your point?"

## Where's the Point?

Principle 5: A reader will feel that a paragraph is coherent if he finds the Point sentence in one of two predictable places in a paragraph:
1. at the end of its issue, or
2. at the end of its discussion; i.e. at the end of the paragraph (or section or whole document)


## Point in Issues
However long the issue, readers expect Point sentences in a predictable position: in the last sentence of an issue. This is called **Point-early**.
- Keep issues short, or otherwise your reader may take your Point to be an earlier sentence.

Purposes of sentences preceding the Point:
- Transaction
 - We can put this abstract notion of issue in simpler terms. Think of an issue as the overture to an opera...
- Generalization that is narrowed in Point sentence
 - ... The most crucial of these, though, is ...
- Claim that the Point sentence rejects
 - Most .. is ... But ...


## Point at the Ends of Discussions
Predictably, a writer will put her Point sentence at the end of the paragraph (**Point-last**) because she intends to **develop**, expand, elaborate, explore that Point **in the following series of paragraphs**.

But if the writer does put the Point sentence at the end of the discussion of the paragraph (or section or document), in its issue he must still use its **issue** to introduce the discussion in a way that **anticipate its topics and themes**.

- Something has happened to the American male's need to *display* the *signs* of *stereotypical masculinity* that once seemed necessary for *survival* on the frontier.
- ...
- These signs of a change in the American male's sexual image of himself suggests something deeper than changes in appearance: he is adapting to a world in which the image of traditional masculinity is no longer necessary for survival.

## Introductory Paragraphs: A Special Problem
- In a single opening paragraph, a paragraph that constitutes the issue to everything that follows, the writer typically locates the main Point sentence **at the end of the paragraph, in the last sentence**.

- And if the opening of an article or report consists of more than one paragraph, then the main Point sentences will appear at the end of the whole opening.


## Points in Whole Documents
Point sentences in paragraphs:
- If the paragraph is a **body** paragraph, if it does not introduce a section or whole document, you can make your Point sentence in either or both of two pieces:
 - at the end of the introductory issue, and
 - at the end of the paragraph; i.e., at the end of the discussion.
- But if the paragraph **introduces** a section or even a whole document, then you should not put your Point sentence at the end of that paragraph.

Similarly, Point sentences in documents:
- At the end of the issue (then again at the end of the document)
- Only at the end of document.

If you make your Point at the end of a document, you must still offer the reader an anticipatory Point. At the end of the introductory issue of your document, you must
- offer some kind of specific anticipatory Point sentence(s) that clearly promise a main Point still to come; and
- include toward the end of that anticipatory Point sentence the themes and topics that you will pursue.

Whether you make your Point early or late, you must always **frame the space** that your reader is about to enter.


## Why Point-last Documents
- Timidity or Politeness

- Discovery

- Convention

- Failure to Revise

## Heading as Test for Coherence
Writers can use headings to diagnose potential problems with the perceived structure of a document.
## The Location of Headings
- In the document, signal the end of your issue and the beginning of your discussion.
- In the body, locate places where you would insert at least one more equvalent level of headings.

If you cannot find the places, you have a problem: you don't know where the **major junctures** are in your own document.

## The Content of Headings
State **central topics and themes**. To determine what those topics and themes should be, simply look at the ends of your issues, at the stress of your Points.

**Two-part titles** are fashinable:

# Emphasis
- Put important new information at **the ends of your sentences**.

- The rising pitch and stress signal the end of a sentence, called **stress**.


## Managing Endings
### Trim the unnecessary end
- Sociobiologists are making the provocative claim that our genes largely determine our social behavior ~~in the way we act in situations we find around us every day~~.

### Shift less important information to the left
- Move unimportant phrases away from the end of a sentence to expose what you want to emphasize
  - The data that are offered to establish the existance of ESP do not make believers of us *for the most part*.
  - *For the most part*, the data that are offered to establish the existance of ESP do not make us believers.
- Separate subjects from verb or verb from objects
  - No one can explain why that first primeval superatom exploded and there by created the universe *in a few words*.
  - No one can explain *in a few words* why that first primeval superatom exploded and there by created the universe.

### Shift important information to the left
- Sentences that introduce a paragraph or a new section are frequently of an *X* is *Y* form. We can reverse the order of subjects and what follows the verb.
  - Those questions relating to the ideal system for providing instruction in home computers are *just as confused*.
  - *Just as confused* are those question relating to the ideal system for providing instruction in home computers.
- Move a relative clause out of the subject
  - A discovery that ... is eminent
  - A discovery is eminent that ...
- Don't shift the clause if it creates an ambiguous construction
  - *A marketing approach* has been developed by the *staff* that will provide us with a new way of looking at our current problems.

### Extract and isolate: break the sentence in two
- Don't let the ideas be swallowed up
  - Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA will promulgate new standards for the treatment of industrial wastewater prior to its discharge into sewers leading to publicly owned treatment plants, with pretreatment standards for types of industrial sources *being discretionary, depending on local conditions*, instead of imposing nationally uniform standards now required under the Act.
  - Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA will promulgate new standards for the treatment of industrial wastewater before it is discharged into sewers leading to publicly owned treatment plants. Unlike the standards now required under the act, the new standards will not be uniform across the whole nation. They instead will be *discretionary, depending on local conditions*.
- At the ends of the sequences, don't repeat words that you read earlier (avoid it or use pronouns, see later)

## Some Syntactic Devices
### There
to stress those ideas that you intend to develop in following sentences.
- There are a few grammatical patterns that *add weight to the end of a sequence*.

### What
to throw special emphasis on what follows a linking verb.
- What this country need is *a monetary policy that ...*

### It-shift
- to shift a long introductory clause from the subject to a position after the verb
  - It once seemed inevitable that *domestic oil prices must eventually rise to the level set by OPEC*.
- simutaneously select and emphasize a topic and throw added weight on the stress
  - It was *in 1933* that *this country experienced a depression that almost wrecked our democratic system of government*.

## Other Ways
### Pronouns
- to prevent repeating words at the ends of sequences
- throw the emphasis before the pronoun
 - When the rate of inflaction dropped in 1983, large numbers of investors fled the bond market and invested in stocks. However, those particularly interested in the high tech market often *did not carefully investigate* them.

### Avoid ending a sentence with metadiscourse
- The opportunities we offer are particularly rich at the graduate level, *it must be remembered*.
- The opportunities we offer, it must be remembered, are particularly rich at the graduate level.

## Nuances of Emphasis
- When you introduce a technical term for the first time--or even a familiar but very important term--design the sentence it appears in so that you can **locate that term at the end, in its stress**, never at the beginning, in its topic.
- A writer can manipulate the stress of sentences in ways that encourage us to respond not to what is new, but to **what we should take as new**, what we should take as familiar.

# Cohesion
Begin with something old and familiar, as a **topic**.

## The Flow of Information
Two complementary principles:
- Put at the beginning of the sentence the ideas that
  - you have already mentioned, referred to, or implied.
  - your reader is already familiar with
- Put at the end of the sentence the ideas that
  - is most surprising, most signifient
  - you will expand on in the next sentence

## Beginning Well
- Connect the sentence to the preceding one, use transitional metadiscourse:
  - *and, but, therefore, as a result*
- Help readers evaluate what follows
  - *fortunately, perhaps, allegedly, it is important to note, for the most part, under these circumstances, from a practical point of view, politically speaking*
- Locate action in time and place
  - *then, later, on May 23, europe*
- Announce its topic (ordinarily in its subject)
  - And therefore, it's important to note, that from a practical point of view, in the Northeastern states in recent years, *these sources of acid rain* have been a matter of much concern.


## Topics: Psychological Subjects
That idea we announce in the first few words of a sentence.
- **Grammatical subjects**
  - Private higher education is seriously concerned about population trends through the end of the century.
- **Object**
  - The reasons for this decision to end the treaty, I cannot explain.
- **Introductory phrases**
  - As for abortion, it is not clear how the Supreme court will rule.


## Keeping Topics Visible
Get rid of unnecessary metadiscourse.


## Managing Subjects and Topics for Flow
A topic string is consistent to the degree that your reader can see connections in the sequence of words and phrases that open your sentences (and clauses).

### Passive again
The main reason the passive exists in the language: to improve cohesion and emphasis.
- These observation have been confirmed by astronomers, physicists, and a host of other researchers entirely familiar with the problems raised by quasars.

### Subject-complememt switching
- More interesting *is* the source of the American attitude towards rural dialects.
- At the heart of the problem *lies* the failure of the administration to halt the rising costs of hospital care.
- Through these questions *run* some complex issues.

### Subject-clause Transformations
- *If* a discovery proceeding closes and an attorney then uncovers documents that might be even peripherally relevant to the matter of the proceeding, *he* must notify both the court and the opposing attorney.


## Consequences of The Two Principles
- You may find yourself writing as many **passive sentences** as active. If active sentences create a less consistent string of topics, leave the sentences passive.
- You may find yourself **using nominalizations as topics** because those nominalizations refer to ideas in sentences that went before. That is an important use of nominalizations: to sum up in one phrase actions you have just mentioned so that you can comment on them.

## Special Problems with Topics
- Audience as Topic
  - to be more readable.
- Designing Topics
  - to assign responsibility of action.
  - e.g. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address

## Summing Up
- Use the **beginning of your sentences** to refer what you have already mentioned or knowledge that you can assume your reader readily share.
  - The huge number of wounded and dead in the Civil War exceeded all the other wars in American history. One of the reasons for the lingering animosity between North and South today is the memory of this terrible carnage.
  - Of all the wars in American history, none has exceeded the Civil War in the huge number of wounded and dead. The memory of this terrible carnage is one of the reasons for the animosity between North and South today.
- Choose **topics** that will control your reader's point of view. This will depend on how creatively you can use verbs to make one or another of your characters the seeming agent of an action.
